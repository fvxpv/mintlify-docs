## Overview
Engagement features help keep your community active and entertained. Run giveaways, create polls, highlight popular messages with starboard, and provide member support through tickets.
---
## Giveaways
Host timed giveaways with automatic winner selection. Perfect for community events, milestones, and promotions.
### Starting a Giveaway
Create a new giveaway in any channel:
```bash
.giveaway start (channel) (duration) (winners) (prize)
.gw start #giveaways 1h 3 Discord Nitro
.gw start #events 2d 1 VIP Role
Duration formats:

s - Seconds (e.g., 30s)
m - Minutes (e.g., 15m)
h - Hours (e.g., 2h)
d - Days (e.g., 7d)
w - Weeks (e.g., 1w)
How it works:

Bot posts an embed with giveaway details
Members react with 🎉 to enter
Winners are randomly selected when time expires
Bot announces the winners automatically
Managing Giveaways
End a giveaway early
.giveaway end (message_link)
.gw end https://discord.com/channels/123/456/789
Reroll winners
If winners don't respond or you want new winners:

.giveaway reroll (message_link)
.gw reroll https://discord.com/channels/123/456/789
Cancel a giveaway
Remove a giveaway before it ends:

.giveaway cancel (message_link)
.gw cancel https://discord.com/channels/123/456/789
List all giveaways

.giveaway list

Polls
Create simple yes/no polls with automatic vote counting and results.

Creating a Poll
.poll (duration) (question)
.poll 1h Should we add a new channel?
.poll 30m Is this feature useful?
.poll 2d Which game should we play?
How it works:

Bot posts the question with your name
Members vote with 👍 (Yes), 👎 (No), or 😐 (Neutral)
After the duration, bot tallies votes and announces results
Duration limits:

Minimum: 10 seconds
Maximum: 7 days
Results show:

Vote counts for each option
Winner (Yes, No, or Tie)
Total participation
Starboard
Automatically highlight popular messages that receive enough reactions. Members can "star" great content to immortalize it.

Setup
Set the channel where starred messages appear:

.starboard set #starboard
.starboard set #hall-of-fame
Configuration
Set reaction threshold
Number of reactions needed to star a message:

.starboard threshold 3
.starboard threshold 5
Default: 3 reactions

Change the star emoji
.starboard emoji ⭐
.starboard emoji ✨
.starboard emoji 🌟
Default: ⭐

Toggle self-starring
Allow/prevent users from starring their own messages:

.starboard selfstar true    # Allow self-stars
.starboard selfstar false   # Prevent self-stars
Customize embed color
.starboard color gold
.starboard color blue
.starboard color #ff6565
Valid colors: red, blue, green, gold, purple, orange, yellow, teal, or hex codes

Toggle timestamp
Show/hide when the message was posted:

.starboard timestamp true
.starboard timestamp false
Ignoring Content
Prevent certain channels, roles, or members from appearing on starboard:

.starboard ignore #staff-chat       # Ignore channel
.starboard ignore @Admin            # Ignore role
.starboard ignore @User             # Ignore member
How it works:

Starred messages from ignored sources won't appear
Helps keep starboard focused on public content
Multiple ignores can be active
Ticket System
Professional support ticket system with transcripts, role permissions, and logging.

Initial Setup
Send a ticket creation panel to a channel:

.ticket setup #tickets
.ticket setup #support
This posts an embed with a "Create" button. Members click it to open tickets.

Configuration
Set support roles
Choose who can view and respond to tickets:

.ticket support @Support @Moderator @Admin
All listed roles get access to tickets automatically.

Set ticket category
Organize tickets under a category:

.ticket category Support
.ticket category 123456789
All new tickets will be created in this category.

Enable DM notifications
Notify ticket creators via DM:

.ticket dms true     # Enable DMs
.ticket dms false    # Disable DMs
Members receive DMs when their ticket closes or is deleted.

Set up logging
Log ticket events to a channel:

.ticket logs #ticket-logs
Track: creates, closes, deletes, transcripts, member leaves, inactivity

Configure inactivity detection
Auto-warn for inactive tickets:

.ticket inactivity true              # Enable detection
.ticket timeout 24                   # Set hours (default: 24)
Bot warns in tickets that haven't had messages in the specified time.

Managing Tickets
Add someone to a ticket
.ticket add @User
Remove someone from a ticket
.ticket remove @User
Rename a ticket
.ticket rename billing-issue
.ticket rename bug-report-123
Ticket Controls
Within any ticket, members and staff can use buttons:

🔒 Close - Closes the ticket, removes creator access
📄 Transcript - Generates HTML transcript of all messages
🗑️ Delete - Deletes the ticket channel (with transcript to logs/DM)

Reset System
Remove all ticket configuration and data:

.ticket reset
Requires confirmation. Use carefully!

Best Practices
<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="Giveaway duration"> Choose appropriate durations: - Quick events: 1-6 hours - Standard giveaways: 1-3 days - Major events: 5-7 days
Avoid extremely short durations (< 1 hour) for fair participation.
</Accordion> <Accordion title="Starboard threshold"> Set threshold based on server size: - Small servers (< 100): 2-3 stars - Medium servers (100-1000): 3-5 stars - Large servers (1000+): 5-10 stars </Accordion> <Accordion title="Ticket organization"> Use categories to keep tickets organized: ```bash .ticket category Support Tickets ``` Separate from regular channels for clarity. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Support role setup"> Assign multiple tiers: ```bash .ticket support @Helper @Moderator @Admin ``` More coverage = faster response times. </Accordion> </AccordionGroup>

Tips & Tricks
<Info> **Giveaway requirements:** Consider using role requirements or entry methods outside the bot (like "join our event") for more controlled giveaways. </Info> <Warning> **Ticket transcripts:** Always enable logs channel to preserve transcripts when tickets are deleted. DMs may fail if members have them disabled. </Warning> <Tip> **Poll engagement:** Keep questions simple and clear. Yes/no format works best for decisive results. </Tip> <Tip> **Starboard quality:** Set threshold high enough to prevent spam but low enough to catch good content. Adjust based on server activity. </Tip>
