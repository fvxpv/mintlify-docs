## Overview
Automations help your server run smoothly by handling repetitive tasks automatically. Set up auto-responses to common triggers and auto-assign roles to new members.
## Autoresponder
Automatically respond to specific trigger words in messages. Perfect for FAQs, greetings, and common inquiries.
### Setup
First, enable the autoresponder system:
```bash
.autoresponder enable
.ar enable
Adding Auto-Responses
Create automatic replies to specific triggers:

.autoresponder add (trigger) (response)
.ar add hello Hi there! Welcome to our server!
.ar add gm Good morning! ☀️
.ar add support Please visit our support channel for help!
How it works:

Triggers are exact word matches (case-insensitive)
The trigger must be a complete word in the message
Only one response per message (first match wins)
Examples:

.ar add hi Hello there!
.ar add faq Check out our FAQ channel!
.ar add rules Please read #rules before chatting!
Managing Responses

Autorole
Automatically assign roles to members when they join your server. Set different roles for humans and bots.

Adding Autoroles
For human members:
.autorole add @Member
.autorole add Member Role
For bot members:
.autorole bots @Bot
.autorole bots Bot Role
Multiple roles: You can add multiple roles - all will be assigned when a member joins.

Examples:

.autorole add @Member
.autorole add @Verified
.autorole bots @Bot Role
Removing Autoroles
Remove a role from both human and bot autorole lists:

.autorole remove @Member
.autorole delete Member Role
Viewing Configuration

Best Practices
<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="Autoresponder trigger selection"> Choose clear, unique triggers: ```bash .ar add faq Check #faq-channel # Good .ar add the We have that # Bad (too common) ``` </Accordion> <Accordion title="Role hierarchy"> Ensure the bot's role is **higher** than autoroles in your server's role list. The bot cannot assign roles higher than its own position. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Autoresponder response length"> Keep responses concise and helpful: ```bash .ar add support Visit #support or open a ticket! ``` Avoid extremely long responses that spam the chat. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Multiple autoroles"> You can assign multiple roles to new members: ```bash .autorole add @Member .autorole add @Unverified ``` All configured roles will be assigned on join. </Accordion> </AccordionGroup>
Tips & Tricks
<Info> **Trigger matching:** Autoresponder uses exact word matching. The trigger "hi" will match "Hi there!" but not "this" or "hiya". </Info> <Warning> **Role position:** If the bot cannot assign a role, check that its role is higher than the autorole in Server Settings → Roles. </Warning> <Tip> **Common use cases:** - Welcome greetings: `.ar add hi Welcome! Check out #rules!` - FAQ shortcuts: `.ar add apply Visit our application form at...` - Support routing: `.ar add help Please open a ticket in #support` </Tip>
