Fun Facts
<Info> **Did you know?** The minesweeper game uses Discord's spoiler tags (`||`) to hide bombs and numbers, making it fully playable without any external links! </Info> <Warning> **Poll limitations:** Polls automatically end after the specified duration. Make sure to choose a duration that gives everyone enough time to vote! </Warning> <Tip> **Avatar downloads:** The avatar command provides multiple format options. Use PNG for transparency, JPEG for smaller file sizes, or WebP for the best quality. </Tip>
